# NOTE: __new__ vs __init__
"""
Method	    Purpose	                        When it Runs
__new__	    Creates a new instance	        Before __init__
__init__	Initializes an existing object	After __new__ returns it
"""

# NOTE: ðŸ§± __new__ â€“ The Builder
"""
Purpose: Actually creates and returns a new instance of the class.

Called first, before __init__.

Used for:
Immutable types (e.g., str, int, tuple)
Custom instance creation (e.g., singleton patterns, metaclasses)

Must return the new object.
"""

# NOTE: ðŸ”§ __init__ â€“ The Initializer
"""
Purpose: Initializes the object that was just created.

Called after __new__

Used for:
Setting up instance attributes

Running any setup code
"""

# NOTE: ðŸ§  In summary:
"""
âœ… __new__ builds the object â†’ only used when you need control over object creation.
âœ… __init__ runs every time an instance is created â†’ used to set up the object.
