# GIL -> Global Interpreter Lock
"""
The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex (or lock) used in CPython,
the standard and most widely used implementation of Python. It allows
only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core processors.
"""

# üîÑ 1. Async (asyncio) ‚Äì Cooperative Concurrency - one block at a time
"""
Single-threaded, non-blocking, event-driven.
Tasks cooperate by yielding control (with await) back to the event loop.
Best for I/O-bound operations: web requests, database calls, file I/O, etc.
"""


# üßµ 2. Threading ‚Äì Preemptive Concurrency - one line at a time
"""
Uses real OS threads (but subject to the GIL in CPython).
Best for I/O-bound tasks with blocking calls (e.g., file/network I/O).
Multiple threads can run "concurrently", but not truly in parallel for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL.
